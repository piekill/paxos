Files
-----
- paxos.da:     multi-paxos protocol
- test0.da:     test case 0
- test1.da:     test case 1
- test2.da:     test case 2
- other files:  DistAlgo-0.5

Usage
-----
Run the test cases using:
    $ python3 -m distalgo.runtime [testcase].da
For example:
    $ python3 -m distalgo.runtime  test0.da
    
Note that paxos.da cannot run without driver programs.

Test cases
----------

Test case 0:
    simply run the code with 5 acceptors, 5 replicas, 3 leaders, 5 clients.
    no error.
    the processes keep running unless no. of requests specified for clients.

Test Case 1 -- acceptors' recovery:
    1. run paxos with 5 acceptors, 5 replicas, 3 leaders, 5 clients
    2. 3 acceptors terminate after 2 seconds (more than half)
    3. clients won't receive results
    4. 1 acceptor recovers after 2 seconds
    5. clients will receive results again

Test Case 2 -- leaders' recovery:
    1. run paxos with 5 acceptors, 5 replicas, 3 leaders, 5 clients
    2. all leaders terminate after 2 seconds
    3. clients won't receive results
    4. 1 leader recovers after 2 seconds
    5. clients will receive results again
